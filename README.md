# FZero-Practice-Hack
A practice romhack for F-Zero. 

Features in-game input display, lap time tracking and every course available to play in Practice Mode.

## How to patch

- Apply the .ips patch to your vanilla F-Zero (US 1.0) ROM with the included Lunar IPS program. 
- Enjoy.

## Known Issues

- Some text that appears onscreen can be partially cut off.
- Using the refiller can glitch out the input display (Will fix itself upon leaving the refiller area)

## Special Thanks

- Zewing for commissioning me.
- The creators of the F-Zero Final romhack, which I referenced to fix course names and borrowed the divide macro.
